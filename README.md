## Project Overview
This project is a case study for the Google Data Analyst Certificate, focusing on the Cyclistic bike-share company in Chicago.
The goal of the project is to analyze how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently 
and provide insights that could inform marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Introduction
The project follows the six stages of data analysis: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. 
The case study answers the business question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently, 
and provides insights that could inform marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

In the different folders, there are visualizations generated from the original Rmarkdown code, an interactive map to navigate and play with, 
and a report in PowerPoint. The original data will be linked because they exceed the maximum size for GitHub uploads.

## Scenario
I am a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The marketing team aims to convert casual riders into annual members. 
This study focuses on understanding the differences in bike usage between casual riders and annual members, which will form the basis for creating data-driven marketing strategies.

## Data Analysis Process

### Ask Phase
The project aims to answer three key questions:
	1.	How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
	2.	Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
	3.	How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

### Prepare Phase
The data used for this project is provided by Divvy, a bike-share company in Chicago. 
Data was cleaned and prepared for analysis, ensuring its reliability by checking for missing values and addressing potential biases.

### Process Phase
Data cleaning involved handling missing values, converting date-time formats, calculating ride durations, and ensuring the data’s integrity. Data was prepared for visualization and further analysis.

### Analyze Phase

The project analyzes bike usage patterns for both casual and annual riders, focusing on metrics such as:

	•	Trip duration
	•	Ride distance
	•	Station usage
	•	Time of day usage (morning/afternoon)
	•	Weekday distribution
### Share Phase

The findings were shared through various visualizations, including bar charts, line charts, and interactive maps. The visualizations are presented in this repository. 
You can also find a summary report in Powerpoint format.

### Act Phase

Based on the analysis, three recommendations were made to Cyclistic’s marketing team:

	1.	Create weekend-based membership plans to convert casual riders.
	2.	Target promotional efforts in high-traffic areas such as Streeter Dr & Grand Ave.
	3.	Focus promotions on weekend leisure trips during the summer.
